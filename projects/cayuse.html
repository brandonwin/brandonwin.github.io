      <h1 class="copy-subhead">An augmented reality experience that revolutionized yearbook.</h1>
      <p class="copy-body">
        During my fourth and last year in my high school yearbook, I launched an augmented reality campaign for our yearbook that added a new dimension (literally) to our coverage and content.
      </p>
      <p class="copy-body">
        Augmented reality was in its growing years, and I found that we could utilize HP Reveal, formerly known as Aurasma, to attach video and photo content to our yearbook. Throughout the year, I recorded videos of events and edited them into 30-40 second snippets that I attached to more than 150 individual spreads.
      </p>
      <p class="copy-body">
        Our yearbook staff then launched a pop-up experience in our school quad that had individual spreads from our yearbook. Students could walk up with their phones and scan spreads of our homecoming, football games or winter break, and my videos would display on their phones. Our campaign was extremely successful in generating more coverage possibilities and interest in our product.
      </p>
      <p class="copy-body">
        Following the success of my AR campaign, my work was later showcased at the Southern California Journalism Education Association (SCJEA) Convention in Los Angeles. Many other schools nationally hadn't considered fully committing to augmented reality coverage, only using it very sparsely throughout their content; I was able to show that augmented reality coverage was a tangible goal.
      </p>
      <p class="copy-body">
        I was also later accepted to intern at the annual YEARBOOKS@theBEACH summer camp, teaching high school students on the potential and feasibility of AR coverage.
